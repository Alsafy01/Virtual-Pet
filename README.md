### 4.2 Algorithm Specifications

#### 4.2.1 Need Decay Algorithm
```
For each need in pet.needs:
    current_value = need.value
    decay_rate = BaseDecayRate[need.type] * pet.species.modifiers[need.type]
    
    # Apply contextual modifiers
    if pet.status.is_sleeping and need.type == "energy":
        decay_rate = -decay_rate  # Energy recovers during sleep
    elif pet.status.is_sick:
        decay_rate *= 1.5  # Needs decay faster when sick
        
    # Calculate time-based decay
    time_elapsed = current_time - need.last_updated
    decay_amount = decay_rate * time_elapsed
    
    # Apply decay and enforce boundaries
    need.value = max(0, min(100, current_value - decay_amount))
    need.last_updated = current_time
```

#### 4.2.2 Mood Determination Algorithm
```
function calculateMood(pet):
    weighted_needs = {
        "hunger": pet.needs.hunger * 0.2,
        "thirst": pet.needs.thirst * 0.15,
        "energy": pet.needs.energy * 0.15,
        "happiness": pet.needs.happiness * 0.2,
        "cleanliness": pet.needs.cleanliness * 0.1,
        "health": pet.needs.health * 0.3
    }
    
    overall_satisfaction = sum(weighted_needs.values()) / sum(weighted_needs.keys())
    
    if overall_satisfaction > 80:
        return "Happy"
    elif overall_satisfaction > 60:
        return "Content"
    elif overall_satisfaction > 40:
        return "Neutral"
    elif overall_satisfaction > 20:
        return "Sad"
    else:
        return "Miserable"
```

#### 4.2.3 Health Status Algorithm
```
function updateHealthStatus(pet):
    critical_needs_count = 0
    
    # Check for critical needs
    if pet.needs.hunger < 20: critical_needs_count += 1
    if pet.needs.thirst < 15: critical_needs_count += 1
    if pet.needs.energy < 10: critical_needs_count += 1
    if pet.needs.cleanliness < 20: critical_needs_count += 1
    
    # Determine health based on critical needs
    if pet.status.is_sick:
        recovery_chance = 0.1 + (pet.needs.health / 200)  # Base recovery + health bonus
        
        if random() < recovery_chance:
            pet.status.is_sick = false
            pet.status.health_status = "Recovering"
        elif critical_needs_count >= 3:
            pet.status.health_status = "Critical"
    else:
        if critical_needs_count >= 3:
            sickness_chance = 0.3 + (0.1 * critical_needs_count)
            if random() < sickness_chance:
                pet.status.is_sick = true
                pet.status.health_status = "Sick"
        else:
            pet.status.health_status = "Healthy"
```
